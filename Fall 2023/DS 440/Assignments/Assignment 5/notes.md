## Assignment Objective

Use the car evaulation dataset below, suppose you want to develop a machine learning model to predict the values in the st column, develop your own function to calculate:

1. The entropy of the original dataset when there is no split.
2. The information gains on choosing each attribute to split the dataset.

### Hint

> *We don't need to construct the complete decision tree in this assignment, please just compute the information gain the first level split using each attribute (column)*.
