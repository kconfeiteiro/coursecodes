        "The square root of a real number $(p > 0)$, can be approximated by the limit of the following sequence, the *Babylonian algorithm*;\n",

        "Write a script in Python to implement this algorithm (with $x_0$ as the **initial guess**) and compare your result with the \"exact\" answer provided by the `math.sqrt(p)`. Outlined below are the steps to be done:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. First, perform three iterations of this algorithm for computing the square root of $p = 4$, starting with the initial guess $x_0 = 1$ (by hand *and* on paper).\n",
        "2. Construct the algorithm: On a sheet of paper, write the tasks that must be performed (request value from the user, read it in, set it equal to $x_n$, & calculate the new values $x_{n + 1}$ iteratively as a sequence of steps).\n",
        "3. How do you decide when to break the iterations? Well, we must choose a pre-specified error tolerance. How do you compute an error if the exact root is not known? Use the following stopping criteria in your code:\n",

        "    \\end{equation*}\n",
        "\n",
        "4. Decide what are the main variables, name them, which one(s) are input (to be read in), and which ones are output (to be determined by the program). Your program should also print the input data so that we will know what input produced the output.\n",
        "5. Translate each task into a Python statement. Be careful how you write the numbers, arithmetic operators, precedence, iterations (`for` or `while` loops), comparison operators, and control flow (`if`, `then`, & `else` statements).\n",
